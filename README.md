Predictive Model
Linear model to predict the number of goals scored by the home team.
Visualization of actual vs predicted home team goals.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): XX
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): XX
Interpretation
The model suggests that factors like the number of goals scored by the home team and away team, recent form, and the away team's losing streak can be predictors of the number of goals scored by the home team.

The model's overall explanatory power is limited, as indicated by the low R-squared value.

Audience Benefits
Team managers and fantasy game players can use the model to gain insights into potential factors influencing a team's goal-scoring performance.

Fans might find it interesting to understand which aspects of team performance are statistically associated with goal-scoring.
